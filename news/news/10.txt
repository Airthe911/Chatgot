As the two sessions draw near, the world is focused on China. Enoch Wong, a Tsinghua University graduate from Hong Kong, who is currently serving as global ambassador of Tsinghua University, shares with us his views on China's democracy."Chinese democracy is something unique, it is not necessarily the same as what we have seen in the West, but it is something that works for this country," Wong said. "I was very impressed with how much these small efforts by local governments and their in-depth understanding of the reality have helped lift millions of people in this country out of poverty."He said the targeted approach of poverty alleviation China employs helps people to become financially strong rather than rely on subsidies. He believes good governance involves the capacity and commitment to act in pursuit of public good, transparency, accountability and citizen participation.
