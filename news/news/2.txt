Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China in 1975, the two countries have cultivated multifaceted cooperation, reinforced by deep-rooted friendship and robust economic and cultural ties, aptly described by the Chinese saying "Thailand and China are one family".This unique bond has weathered unprecedented challenges, global polarization and economic recession, while maintaining the trajectory of positive and deepened bilateral cooperation through dynamic exchanges between different sectors at all levels.President Xi Jinping's landmark visit to Thailand in November 2022 for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, 11 years after his last visit as vice-president and his first since assuming office as Chinese president, was most timely and of particular significance as 2022 marked the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between Thailand and China. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in various areas through the promotion of trade, investment, and infrastructure connectivity and customs facilitation, as well as cooperation in the digital economy, new energy vehicles and artificial intelligence, and promotion of people-to-people relations, especially among youths, with a view to fostering friendship and understanding between the two countries.The outcomes of the visit laid a solid foundation for the building of a Thailand-China community with a shared future for enhanced stability, prosperity and sustainability.Furthermore, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai's working visit to Beijing in February 2023 and his meeting with Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, and Qin Gang, China's foreign minister, highlighted the robust momentum and close friendship shared between the high-level officials of the two countries.During the same month, Thailand's ministers of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, and Tourism and Sports also led a delegation to China to enhance cooperation in the fields of technology, science, education, sports, culture and tourism. These visits speak volumes of the dynamism and depth of the cooperation.Like with most Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, economic and trade cooperation remains the fulcrum of the bilateral relations. In this regard, I would like to share several observations on the great strides we have made in the past year and the outlook for the years ahead.First, China has been Thailand's largest trade partner for 10 consecutive years since 2013 and bilateral trade continues to expand despite the impact of COVID-19. However, China still enjoys a huge trade surplus and there remains room for growth to increase the diversity of trade products and reap the benefits from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement.Events hosted by China, such as the 6th China International Import Expo and the 20th China-ASEAN Expo, will help to further strengthen economic ties.Second, in 2022 China was Thailand's largest source of foreign direct investment applications through the Board of Investment of Thailand, with 158 projects and a combined investment totaling about 77.4 billion Baht ($2.2 billion), constituting around 18 percent of total investment value, surpassing Japan and the United States. BYD, China's top electric vehicle producer, officially made Thailand its first passenger car production hub in Southeast Asia. Thailand invites other Chinese companies to invest in the industries of the future by utilizing Thailand's developed supply chain, favorable investment policies and strong domestic demand.Third, Thailand was China's largest tourist destination in the pre-COVID era, receiving in excess of 10 million visitors a year. After China opened its borders, Thailand was among the first countries to welcome Chinese tourists with open arms. Thailand welcomes more Chinese friends to experience the authentic Thai culture through its"5F" soft-power, comprising food, film, fashion, fighting (Thai boxing) and festival.Last, Thailand and China's bilateral and regional economic policies are highly compatible and complementary. During the APEC meeting in Thailand last year, the two leaders along with other APEC member economies jointly endorsed the Bangkok Goals on Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model. As Thailand's national agenda and homegrown approach to promote sustainable development, the BCG Economy Model, as well as the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, aligns well with the China-proposed Global Development Initiative and conforms to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thailand is committed to working with China and all partners to promote the new paradigms of growth in this region, as sustainable development takes two and more to tango.Looking forward, new breakthroughs and opportunities await in 2023. Thailand welcomes the convening of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary, and is committed to expediting connectivity in the region through the advancement of the Thailand-Laos-China Connectivity Development Corridor. To co-chair the Mekong-Lancang Cooperation with China in 2023 and 2024, Thailand is determined to build resilience, enhance integration and interoperability, foster synergy among Mekong cooperation frameworks and create an enabling ecosystem conducive to business and innovation in the post-COVID era, so that Mekong-Lancang Cooperation member countries can jointly "R-I-S-E" together to overcome challenges and attain win-win cooperation.In light of the special bond between the two countries, and as China's leading partner in the region to achieve high-quality and sustainable development, Thailand stands ready to deepen comprehensive and strategic cooperation and looks forward to engaging in more meaningful cooperation while elevating the cooperation to achieve its fullest potential.Through common endeavors and by working hand in hand, new heights and milestones will be reached as the two countries sail toward a new era of bilateral cooperation in building the Thailand-China community with a shared future for enhanced stability, prosperity and sustainability.
